## Lessons Learned
In the course of working on this portfolio project, I got hands-on experience with the dynamics of both frontend and backend development using Express. This practical exposure was particularly helpful in demystifying backend concepts, making them more approachable. Exploring the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure within this tech stack added another layer to my understanding, providing insights into the organized flow of models, views, and controllers. Altogether, this experience offered a balanced and insightful learning journey into the intricacies of frontend and backend development.
